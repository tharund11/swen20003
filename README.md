# Shadow Life Game Simulator
This was my submission for Object Oriented Software Development (SWEN20003) - Project 2. The task was to implement in Java, a simulation of a video game where the world and its actors are given by the input csv file. The BAGEL library was used to implement the graphics.

More information about the task is in the [specification](https://github.com/tharund11/swen20003/blob/main/project2-3.pdf).
